1. Database & Backend Structure:
Before you dive deep into the front-end functionalities, you need to ensure that your backend is structured to handle the different functionalities.

Users Table: Contains user information, including a list of their friends and their profiles.

Lists Table: Each list should have an associated user (creator), items, and privacy settings (public/private).

Events Table: Information about the event, including the creator, participants, associated lists, and other meta-data.

2. Friendship Mechanism:
Since the interaction is between friends:

Friend Requests: Allow users to send, accept, or decline friend requests.

Friends List: Users can view their friends, pending requests, and manage their friends' list from their profile page.

3. Creating Lists:
New List Page: Users should be able to create a new list, add items, set its privacy (public or private), and save it.

View Lists: A dedicated page to view all the userâ€™s lists. They can also choose to share a list with specific friends or make it public.

4. Event Creation & Collaboration:
Event Page: User 2 can initiate a new event based on User 1's list. User 1 can't see this event (because it's private), but User 2 can invite other friends to collaborate.

Collaboration: Friends invited to an event can view the list (without editing it) and discuss or assign who will buy which item. This way, there's no overlap, and everything is transparent among friends but hidden from the list owner.

Notifications: Notify User 1 when a new event is created based on their list, and also notify other users when they're added to an event.

5. UI/UX Improvements:
Dashboard: Once logged in, users can have a dashboard showing their lists, upcoming events, friend requests, and notifications.

Search: Allow users to search for friends, lists, or events.

6. Testing & Feedback:
After implementing the core functionalities:

Beta Testing: Let a group of users test your application. Collect feedback about the user experience, bugs, or additional features.

Iterate: Based on feedback, make necessary changes and improvements.

7. Expand Features:
Once the core functionalities are stable:

Group Chats: Implement a chat feature for participants of an event.

Wishlist Recommendations: Offer recommendations for gifts based on trending items, user preferences, or past purchases.

Integration: Allow adding items to the list directly from e-commerce sites.

Conclusion:
Starting with the backend structure and progressively building the front-end based on the functionalities will offer a structured approach. Since you already have a robust registration and login mechanism, moving onto the Friendship mechanism might be a logical next step, followed by list and event management.

Remember, the key to building a successful application is iterative development. Start with the core features, test, get feedback, and then expand.
