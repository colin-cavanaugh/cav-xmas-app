What is React Context?
React Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's designed to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

How does it work?
createContext: This function creates a new context and provides two main components:

Provider: Every context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. You wrap a part of your component tree with this provider, and it can pass the value down to any component in that tree.
Consumer: This is a component that subscribes to context changes. However, with the advent of the useContext hook in React, the direct use of Consumer has been reduced. The hook provides a more direct and readable way to consume context values.
useContext: This hook allows you to consume the nearest context. It's a simpler and cleaner way than using the Consumer component.

How does it fit into your project?
Global State Management: For properties or functionalities that are used across multiple components (or even across the entire application), it makes sense to store them in a context. This includes things like user data, themes, language settings, etc.

Avoiding Prop-Drilling: If you find that you're passing the same prop through several layers of components just to use it in a deeply nested one, Context can simplify this. Instead of passing the prop through every layer, you can provide it at the top layer and consume it in the nested component directly using Context.

Your UserListService Context:
Purpose of UserListProvider: This context will make the user's list available throughout the app, so wherever you want to access the user's list or modify it, you'll be able to do so without having to pass it through props.

Functionalities: Any method or functionality that deals with a user's list can be defined in UserListService. For example:

Fetching the user's list from the backend.
Updating the user's list when a new item is added.
Deleting items from the user's list.
Categorizing the list.
Accessing and Modifying the List: In any component, you can access and modify the user's list using the useUserList hook. This hook will give you access to the current userList and the setUserList function, allowing you to both read and modify the list.

Events and List functionalities:
Events Component: Since events can be created by anyone and might be associated with specific lists, you'll need functionalities to:

Create new events.
Invite users to events.
Associate specific user lists with events.
Lists Component: For the lists, your functionalities would include:

Creating new lists.
Categorizing lists.
Editing and deleting lists.
Associating lists with events.
Given the interconnected nature of these functionalities, you might find it helpful to have additional contexts (e.g., EventsContext) or to integrate these functionalities into existing contexts (e.g., UserListService) if they are tightly coupled.

Final Thoughts:
React Context is a powerful tool, especially for global state management. However, it's essential to strike a balance. Not everything should be in context. Only place values in context if they are genuinely used across multiple components.

For more complex state management with side-effects, asynchronous actions, and more, you might also consider libraries like Redux or MobX. These libraries are built on top of the Context API but provide more advanced features and methodologies for managing state in larger applications.
